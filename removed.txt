My childlike creativity purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin up with me
Takin my inner child Im fighting for its custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamondencrusted piece
Thinkin no one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin I just count the hours
Stop trippin Im trippin off the powder
Til then fuck that the worlds oursAnd then they say hey and then they say
And then they say hey and then they say
And then they say hey and then they say 21st century schizoid manHoly powers Austin Powers

Im coming home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Cause Im coming home againI met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me lil homey I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astounding
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for meIm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Cause Im coming home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Cause Im coming home again
Maybe we can start againBut if you really cared for her
Then you wouldnt have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking bout me
She said You left your kids and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talking bout what niggas tryna do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that When I was back home
Every interview Im representing you making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talking bout ChiTownIm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Cause Im coming home againMaybe you do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh now Im coming home again
Maybe you do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh now Im coming home again
Maybe we can start again

Must be the pharoahs he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold

DJs need to listen to the models
You aint got no fuckin Yeezy in your Serato
You aint got no Yeezy nigga
Stupid but what the fuck do I know

And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head I woke up to Sleepy HollowCan we get much higher
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohLook like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire Im the King of Leon and Louis
Beyond the truest
Hey teacher teacher
Tell me how do you respawn the students
And refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But whats worse the pain or the hangover
Fresh air rolling down the window
Too many Urkels on your team thats why your wins low
Dont make me pull the toys out huh
Dont make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noiseCan we get much higher So high
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohAt the mall there was a seance
Just kids no parents
Then the sky filled with heroines
I saw the devil In a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell it wouldnt spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that took pills kissed an heiress
And moved her back in ParisCan we get much higher So high
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohOhCan we get much higher So high
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Can we get much higher So high
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh when it all it all falls down
Im telling you oh it all falls down
Oh when it all it all falls down
Im telling you oh it all falls downMan I promise shes so self conscious
She has no idea what shes doing in college
That major that she majored in dont make no money
But she wont drop out her parents will look at her funny
Now tell me that aint insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years aint picked a career
She like fuck it Ill just stay down here and do hair
Cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy dont really care
Shes so precious with the peer pressure
Couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you cant believe
Single black female addicted to retail and wellOh when it all it all falls down
Im telling you oh it all falls downMan I promise Im so self conscious
Thats why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I cant even pronounce nothing pass that versace
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
And I cant even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper look how low we astoop
Even if you in a Benz you still a nigga in a coopcoupeOh when it all it all falls down
Im telling you oh it all falls downI say fuck the police thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom
Well buy a lot of clothes when we dont really need em
Things we buy to cover up whats inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
Thats why shortys hollering where the ballas at
Drug dealer buy Jordans crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I aint even goin act holier than thou
Cause fuck it I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and Id do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like its all terrific
I got a couple past due bills I wont get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious Im just the first to admit itOh when it all it all falls down
Im telling you oh it all falls down
Oh when it all it all falls down
Im telling you oh it all falls down 
I drink a Boost for breakfast an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry Mr HtotheIzzos back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her sons on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a Delta so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots but I aint Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I aint trying to make a band
I swear this right here history in the making manWhat if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around
But he wasnt talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except hes really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude bad night right place wrong time
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I aint too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep whats in my safe safe
My dawgs couldnt tell if I
Looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky it was televised
Theres been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable what you thought theyd call me Mr Glass
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up Im a grownass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But Im a champion so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music thats fire spit my soul through the wire

Try to catch it its kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method
They be asking us questions harass and arrest us
Saying We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast
Huh Yall eat pieces of shit Whats the basis
We aint goin nowhere but got suits and cases

Cause were the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we dont think

Or here to convert atheists into believers
Im just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis thats the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns sex lies video tape
But if I talk about God my record wont get played
Huh
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that Im dreaming about
Next time Im in the club everybody screaming outJesus Walks
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
Jesus Walks with me with me with me
The only thing that I pray is that me feet dont fail me now 
Verse 1 Kanye West
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I cant jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
Im the only one thats in control
I been feeling all Im giving
For my children
I will die for those I love
God Im willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul my soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soulHook The Weeknd
Wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Cant let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention meVerse 2 Kanye West
See before I let you go one last thing I need to let you know
You aint never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that like time the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say dont text me hoe
Told you four times dont test me hoe
Now we finna lose all self control
But you aint finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But Imma have the last laugh in the end

Whos faultLets play the blame game I love you more

As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it you know we both were wrongBut I love to play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call out names names I hate you more
Lets call out names names for sureOn a bathroom wall I wrote
Id rather argue with you than to be with someone else else else else
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing harvesting the feelings Id rather be by my fucking self
Till about 2 AM and I call back and I hang up and start to blame myself
Somebody helpLets play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call out names names I hate you more
Lets call out names names for sure
Ill call you bitch for sureYou werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you
In a bathroom gripping you up and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mineAnd you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is stroking you
Might say I hit you
He sitting there consoling you
Rubbing my name threw the mud
Whos provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable like cant nobody get control you
1 am and cant nobody get a hold of you
Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever you gon told him too
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Chuck dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I aint youre right girl
You probably find one of them I like art type girls
All of the lights she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
And who to blame you to blame me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame gameI love you more
Lets play the blame game for sureThings used to be now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
Weve become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gon for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of LOVE
Hatred and attitude tear us entirelyLets play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call out names names I hate you more
Lets call out names names for sureI cant love you this much
I cant love you this much
I cant love you this much
I cant love you this much

No I cant love you this much

This shit unanimous for you its damaging for you I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math
That shit dont add up youre making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an Alist rapper
I said baby spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
Youre dealing with malpractice dont kill a good niggas confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you dont know what a condom is
The head still good though the head still good though
Make me say Nam Myoho Renge Kyo
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles Buddhist monks and Capn Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service head service I came in first place
The opportunity the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G I was all for it
She said K Lamar you kind of dumb to be a poet
Imma put you on game for the lames that dont know theyre a rookie

No more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LAVerse 2 Kanye West
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldnt let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list I wasnt even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs somebody gon get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks man you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I cant fault em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she aint going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin
Of weak content and slow jammin
But dont worry this ones so jammin
You know it LA its so jammin
I be thinkin every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some god damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure the problem aint I be drivin
The problem is I be textin
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was bout their friend that just died
Textin and drivin down Mulholland Drive
Thats why Id rather take the 405
I be worried bout my daughter I be worried bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye I aint worried bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What Im supposed to do
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints
Every agent I know know I hate agents
Im too black Im too vocal Im too flagrant
Something smellin like shit thats the new fragrance
Its just me I do it my way bitch
Some days Im in my Yeezys some days Im in my Vans
If I knew yall made plans I wouldnt have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldnt rap like this again
But the writers block is over emcees cancel your plans
A 38yearold 8yearold with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I dont never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God damn got a bald fade I might slam
Pink fur got Nori dressing like Cam thank God for me
Whole family gettin money thank God for E
I love rockin jewelry a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when Im workin on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when Im workin on my house
Tell em partys in here we dont need to go out
We need the turbo thots high speed turbo thots
Dropdrodrodrodrop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach good dickll do that
She keep pushin me back good dickll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dickll put your ass to sleep
Get money money money money
Big big money money money money

You want me to give you a testimony about my life and how good hes been to me

I love him so much because hes done so much for me
No matter what youve been through or where youve been hes always there
With his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much

Im crying now it feels so good to be free to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what
