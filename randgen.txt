Well, see you later.
The lyrics are humorous.
Do you know Persian?
You're mistaken about that.
It's an old picture.
Fish are cold-blooded animals.
Someone should try this.
Ken cried for help.
I chopped some onions.
Please, madam, help yourself!
I think that helps.
Are they all right?
He didn't have nightmares.
Tom did that, too.
Tom majored in economics.
That castle is beautiful.
I let her down.
The Internet has spoken.
Tom wasn't totally surprised.
Tom scored four goals.
I called the police.
His invention is brilliant!
He's afraid of snakes.
She has many dogs.
Tom talked about Boston.
You like an elephant.
My sister is married.
I finally got it.
They all looked happy.
Be careful. That hurts!
How's the weather there?
The explanation is clear.
Tom needs more money.
I ended up winning.
Any improvement is good.
The bride suddenly laughed.
All beginnings are difficult.
I expect your help.
Just answer one question.
Let's assume you're right.
Are you accusing Tom?
Use the manual override.
The days got shorter.
That film's really interesting.
I booked the field.
I don't see anything!
I'm letting you go.
It wasn't real love.
These are special circumstances.
Tell her to stop.
The balloons are bright.
I bit my tongue.
Tom moistened his lips.
These lights are beautiful!
We talked about basketball.
Aunt, this is Tom.
I never told her.
I can't really remember.
Three cubed makes twenty-seven.
Tom untied the ribbon.
It's crowded again today.
They're in their element.
Has he failed again?
She couldn't afford it.
I get motion sickness.
Died at age 54.
We have three weeks.
She has many handkerchiefs.
They opened the door.
It was not conclusive.
What shall we play?
It's your decision, Tom.
That's not an insult.
Who discovered the island?
She is getting old.
Tom won't escape punishment.
I feel pretty well.
Tom wants our help.
Am I annoying you?
What a big surprise!
I enjoyed your company.
Have you been arrested?
It's on page 3.
It's a big universe.
He fulfilled his obligation.
She took copious notes.
He has white teeth.
It's not that scary.
The dog is red.
Shopping makes me happy!
I want a refund!
He's a Jewish American.
Tom has a radio.
Tom's snowmobile is broken.
Do you like these?
Mary called me names.
Tom majored in history.
Add up these figures.
Her hair is tangled.
They liked big cars.
I'm not like that.
Mary's lipstick is smeared.
Everyone laughed, except Tom.
Tom has a stomachache.
Tom is highly qualified.
Let the children play.
She's much better today.
Raise your right hand.
Tom's party was boring.
On this, we agree.
Nobody wants to work.
You're driving too fast.
I hardly remember her.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Let's have her decide.
I hate keeping secrets.
Is this Tom's residence?
What'll your choice be?
Mariko speaks English well.
I can't believe Tom.
I need to leave.
I guess that's good.
Tom accidentally shot himself.
I like playing basketball.
I sure hope so.
Oh, a chocolate bunny!
Who went with you?
Strong winds are expected.
What's Tom's middle name?
No one dances sober.
Please show your ticket.
She seems down lately.
I voted for her.
He felt very lonely.
Where is the woman?
You're always welcome here.
Was it of help?
This website is useless.
I can handle those.
Tom wouldn't remember me.
You're going too fast.
Unfortunately, that didn't happen.
She's obsessed with books.
I love that story.
Wow, it's hot today.
Please listen to reason.
I'll come by 10.
She answered me back.
Tom watched television yesterday.
After death, the doctor.
Don't neglect your business.
You should exercise more.
I'm a good mother.
I am studying Persian.
Everyone knows everyone else.
He's circling the drain.
It's Germany's highest mountain.
I'm bad at sports.
It's your favorite song.
This is absolutely correct.
I found it there.
We're going to church.
I am growing breasts.
Not until tomorrow afternoon.
He will catch us.
I really like you.
Is this your book?
Tom bandaged Mary's hand.
His brother bullied me.
You should've said yes.
That's a bright idea.
Would you relax, please?
Tom can't be trusted.
You're a powerful woman!
Look what they're doing.
Goodbye. See you tomorrow.
We'll pay for it.
You lied to me!
Will you go there?
The station is nearby.
I'm considering all possibilities.
I've got to study.
I'm not like you.
I'm not being defensive.
Tom ripped you off.
A car cut in.
Tom's a money-grubbing opportunist.
My mother speaks slowly.
I love watching birds.
Tom sat facing Mary.
I'm dreading the exam.
He's just a liar.
I'll give her that.
I need an interpreter.
The chance is gone.
How tall are you?
He had few teeth.
Do a little gymnastics!
I think we're OK.
He left just now.
We'll take her home
I don't belong here
Could I work part-time?
Tom's son is sick.
We're worried about him.
You make a box.
She accepted our invitation.
Our train already left.
We've all become communists.
Your proposal sounds good.
She is too meek.
It won't stop bleeding.
We could ask him.
He has got cancer.
I'm a little disappointed.
It was getting dark.
Tom wants to win.
Let me help them.
Don't respond to that.
Let's end this debate.
Bill was in Japan.
We solved both problems.
How is Tom doing?
Get along with you!
Is this an actress?
It is my cat.
I think we're fine.
The message was fake.
I am a runner.
We've become good friends.
Tom doesn't listen anymore.
Something is very wrong.
I'll be in Boston.
Is French pronunciation difficult?
Youth is wholly experimental.
This room is quiet.
Don't get so angry.
Tom caught a cold.
You can't eat here.
I've lost my ticket.
Everybody is doing something.
I wrote it down.
I've seen better days.
I trust my intuition.
This river flows rapidly.
The bedouins were nomads.
Does that seem wise?
You must quit smoking.
Is it right, Ms./Mr.?
Why the big hurry?
Stop spending my money.
He's a practical man.
You are home late.
It's okay to cry.
She talks so much.
Tom looks very tense.
Someone will do it.
This is Tony's book.
Is it real expensive?
They labored like slaves.
Tom is extremely easygoing.
Where is your family?
They visited me occasionally.
Tom must've done it.
You have bad breath.
Are you ready now?
Mary is a lesbian.
You're blocking my view.
He wants peanut butter.
Oh, here comes Chris.
I want that one.
Why don't you go?
He deals in furniture.
What's different about Tom?
Are you a translator?
I'll accept that responsibility.
Tom kissed Mary romantically.
Welcome to the club.
Always seeking the truth.
I've climbed Mt. Fuji.
The fork is bent.
I've got a toothache.
Hunger knows no law.
Did you hear something?
The ships reached port.
I hope you win.
He will probably fail.
I'm feeling fine, thanks.
I'm eating a banana.
You're a brilliant photographer.
A shot rang out.
I just got that.
Nothing can move him.
Don't waste your ammunition.
I'll never tell anybody.
I'm not an addict.
The crowd dispersed quickly.
Sleep off the problem.
Nothing is ever right.
Tom did it single-handedly.
