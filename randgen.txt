Many years went by.
I entered Tom's room.
Tom treated me badly.
Here comes the bus!
Tom wants to watch.
An ambulance arrived immediately.

Is it going well?

Unfortunately, there's a problem.
Tom wiped his forehead.
I suspected as much.
I am not ill.
The thief ran quickly.
These shoes are mine.
Get your facts right.
You're not allowed here.
Our train already left.
I thought Tom confessed.
These are beautiful bookcases.

There was a silence.
Animals follow their instincts.
We're going to lose.
You should stay back.
Tom is completely bald.
Don't ask me why.
She's my wife's friend.
Let's get together tomorrow.
You were there, right?
Construction started in October.
Tom did absolutely nothing.
Tom probably likes you.
Where is it located?
Is it a compliment?
Who is the author?
There may be others.
You'd better eat something.

When are you busy?
Give me some credit.
He will catch us.
He is an albino.
I like your place.
Tom does sloppy work.
You're tired this evening.

Lambs are very cute.
I don't recommend them.
She testified against him.
Tom has left us.
The cut still hurts.
I'm through with Tom.
I feel romantic today.
Our universe is expanding.
It was raining yesterday.
Sleep off the problem.
Her bicycle is blue.
Don't laugh at me.
She told me it.
You're joking, aren't you?

What year is this?
Those are extenuating circumstances.

He made her happy.
He read a lot.
Tom is Mary's uncle.
You have already eaten.
The end is nigh.
What is your destination?
We all seek comfort.
I'm OK with it.
These cars are big.
The music started again.
The chance is gone.
Don't make me suffer.
Her parents were horrified.
He has white teeth.
Your complaints bore me.
Maybe it wasn't her.
I am not Melissa.
We should come in.
Tom's a money-grubbing opportunist.

It was very interesting.
