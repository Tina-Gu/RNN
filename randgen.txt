Well, see you later.
The lyrics are humorous.
Do you know Persian?
You're mistaken about that.
It's an old picture.
Fish are cold-blooded animals.
Someone should try this.
Ken cried for help.
I chopped some onions.
Please, madam, help yourself!
I think that helps.
Are they all right?
He didn't have nightmares.
Tom did that, too.
Tom majored in economics.
That castle is beautiful.
I let her down.
The Internet has spoken.
Tom wasn't totally surprised.
Tom scored four goals.
I called the police.
His invention is brilliant!
He's afraid of snakes.
She has many dogs.
Tom talked about Boston.
You like an elephant.
My sister is married.
I finally got it.
They all looked happy.
Be careful. That hurts!
How's the weather there?
The explanation is clear.
Tom needs more money.
I ended up winning.
Any improvement is good.
The bride suddenly laughed.
All beginnings are difficult.
I expect your help.
Just answer one question.
Let's assume you're right.
Are you accusing Tom?
Use the manual override.
The days got shorter.
That film's really interesting.
I booked the field.
I don't see anything!
I'm letting you go.
It wasn't real love.
These are special circumstances.
Tell her to stop.
The balloons are bright.
I bit my tongue.
Tom moistened his lips.
These lights are beautiful!
We talked about basketball.
Aunt, this is Tom.
I never told her.
I can't really remember.
Three cubed makes twenty-seven.
Tom untied the ribbon.
It's crowded again today.
They're in their element.
Has he failed again?
She couldn't afford it.
I get motion sickness.
Died at age 54.
We have three weeks.
She has many handkerchiefs.
They opened the door.
It was not conclusive.
What shall we play?
It's your decision, Tom.
That's not an insult.
Who discovered the island?
She is getting old.
Tom won't escape punishment.
I feel pretty well.
Tom wants our help.
Am I annoying you?
What a big surprise!
I enjoyed your company.
Have you been arrested?
It's on page 3.
It's a big universe.
He fulfilled his obligation.
She took copious notes.
He has white teeth.
It's not that scary.
The dog is red.
Shopping makes me happy!
I want a refund!
He's a Jewish American.
Tom has a radio.
Tom's snowmobile is broken.
Do you like these?
Mary called me names.
Tom majored in history.
Add up these figures.
Her hair is tangled.
They liked big cars.
